## Organizations

When you sign up for Cloud 66 you will have your own organization even if you sign up to join a team. To switch your organization, use the dropdown menu in the top right corner of your Cloud 66 account, and simply select the name of the organization you would like to switch to.


#### Note
<div class="notice notice-warning"><p>
There will not be any dropdown if you are part of <strong>only one</strong> (account owner) organization 
</p></div>

## Service accounts

Service accounts are special, limited accounts that belong to a team (not to account owners) and that have no login privileges on your main Cloud 66 account. They are useful for centralizing automated actions such as webhooks, API calls and notifications. This allows people to leave and join your team(s) without any danger of breaking integrations or duplicating notifications. For more info please read our full guide to service accounts.
