## Infrastructure security
Our servers are protected with firewalls and intrusion protection systems to protect from malicious traffic. We have lock-out mechanisms in place to prevent automated attacks, as well as monitoring for any malicious activity, and logging.


## Credit Card Information

We do not store any payment information like credit card details on our servers. All credit card information is handled by a third party ([Stripe](http://stripe.com/)).


## Customer protection

All customer sensitive data including API keys, SSH keys and passwords are encrypted with a multi-network setup for the decryption mechanism.

We take a wide range of other measures to improve user's [stack security]({% if page.collection == "skycap" %}/maestro/how-to-guides/deployment/service-network-configuration.html{% else %}/{{page.collection}}/tutorials/service-network-configuration.html{% endif %}) and help them improve their security by upgrading their stacks. Cloud 66 connects to user's servers only from `54.84.166.97` address and all provisioned servers are configured to only allow connections from this IP.

Additionally, customer source code is only kept for a limited period of time.

## Reporting security issues

We take customer security very seriously. Please [contact us](mailto:hello@cloud66.com) if you would like to talk to us about security.
