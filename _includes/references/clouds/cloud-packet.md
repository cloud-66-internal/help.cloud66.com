You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in [Packet](https://www.packet.net/).

## Adding your Packet credentials

Visit the Cloud 66 Dashboard and select Get started building a application. After connecting to your Git repository and analyzing your code, you will be asked to _Add your cloud platform_. From this menu, select Packet and provide your Packet API Key from _API Keys_ on your _Packet Dashboard_.
