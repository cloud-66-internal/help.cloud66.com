## Using team accounts

Adding new users to your Cloud 66 account is a great way to work in a team, and access rights can be fine-tuned per application. Access levels range from no privileges on an application to full administrative privileges.

## User roles and permissions

The account administrator is the only user who can invite other members and change access rights for these members (unless this privilege is granted to another user). There are two types of users - _Finance users_ and _Application (stack) users_.

Finance users only have access to your _Payment_ page, and can change billing information. They will receive payment notifications (successful and unsuccessful payments), but have no access rights to stacks. We do not charge for Finance users.

Application users have access rights to applications and different part of the organization under Cloud 66. You can specify the exact access rights you would like to grant to per application by choosing a role for them (you can define a customized role). The available roles for application users are:

- No role
- Viewer
- Deployer
- Developer
- Operation
- Power user
- Administrator

By definition, any user with access to an application will automatically be given the rights for the lower levels of permissions. For example, a user who can control an application will also be able to deploy and view that same stack. You can even customize these pre-defined roles, however, we recommend adding a role for custom permissions.

You also have the option of allowing team members to create a new application. The creator of an application becomes its default administrator, although this setting can be changed by the team leader. In addition to this, you can also allow a user to control permissions for others.

## Add a team member


1. Open your [Dashboard](https://app.cloud66.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your account avatar (top-right) and select *Account Settings*
4. You need to give your team a name before inviting other members. This is the same as your _Company name_ on the _Payments_ page. If you already have entered a company name, you will skip this part.
5. Click on _Team_ in the left-hand panel
6. Click the **+** button in the top right corner. This will allow you to choose a user type (Stack or Finance user), input an email address and set the users permissions and its default role for applications.

An email will be sent to the email address specified, giving this user the option to sign up for Cloud 66 with their specified email address. If the invited email already has a Cloud 66 account, they will be notified of the pending invitation. By accepting the invitation, they will join your team.

## Switch organizations

If you are part of several organizations, you will have to switch organization to see applications that belong to a different organization. 

To switch between organizations, click on your account avatar (top-right) and and select the name of the organization you would like to switch to.

## Leave a team

To leave a team, visit the _Account Settings_ page, then click _Organizations_. Next, find the organization you would like to leave, and click the _Leave_ button.

You cannot leave your primary organization (the one you own).
