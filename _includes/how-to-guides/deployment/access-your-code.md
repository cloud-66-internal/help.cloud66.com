## Public repositories

For public Git repositories, you don't need to add the SSH key provided to your Git account. You simply need to provide the Git URL as either

`http://<git provider>/<username>/<repository>.git`  

or   

`git://<git provider>/<username>/<repository>.git`

This URL is often automatically generated by your Git provider.

## Private repositories

For Cloud 66 to access your private repositories (with read-only access), you first need to add the SSH key provided by Cloud 66 to your account with your git provider. To find this key:

1. Open your [Dashboard](https://app.cloud66.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your account avatar (top-right) and select *Account Settings*
3. Click on *Git Repo SSH Keys* in the **Settings** panel on the left
4. Copy the **Git public SSH Key** and add it to your Git repo provider

You can add this SSH key globally to your git provider by adding it to your **Account settings**, or allow access to a specific repository by adding it to that repository as a **deploy key**.
