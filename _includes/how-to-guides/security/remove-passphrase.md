## Overview

Nginx does not support password protected certificate keys for SSL. If your keys are already password protected, you can remove them using the method below.

#### Note
<div class="notice notice-warning"><p>This method applies to OpenSSL. If you are using another SSL library or provider then this method will not apply.</p></div>

## Removing a passphrase using OpenSSL

1. Copy the private key file into your OpenSSL directory (or specify the path in the command below).

2. Run this command:
`openssl rsa -in [original.key] -out [new.key]`

3. Enter the passphrase for the original key when asked

4. The output file [new.key] should now be unencrypted. To verify this open the file with a text editor and check the headers.

Encrypted headers look like this:
```shell
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED DEK-Info: DES-EDE3-CBC,

6BD407785DD187EF...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Unencrypted headers look like this:
```shell
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
6BD407785DD187EF...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```
