## About deploying databases

We currently support the following databases, with no need for additional configuration after deployment.

* MySQL (or Percona if [configured via Manifest](/{{page.collection}}/how-to-guides/deployment/building-a-manifest-file.html#mysql))
* PostgreSQL
* MongoDB
* Redis
* Elasticsearch
* RabbitMQ
* SQLite (only in development environments)
* GlusterFS
* InfluxDB

{%if page.collection=='rails' %}For Rack-based stacks, Cloud 66 automatically detects whether your application relies on a database or not during your code analysis. This is based on a combination of your Gemfile and your `database.yml` or `mongoid.yml` files.

{%endif%}

After you have analyzed your code, ensure that your desired database type is displayed in the _About your app_ section of the analysis results. If you haven't specified a username and password for your database, Cloud 66 will automatically generate these credentials for you. They will be available as environment variables and your application will be configured to use them.

{%if page.collection=='rails' %}
#### Note 
<div class="notice notice-warning"><p>If your <code>database.yml</code> file has a <code>url</code> defined, we will assume that you are using <strong>an external (self-managed) database</strong>, and will follow that URL accordingly. This also means we <strong>won't</strong> set any of the database variables (such as username and password) the way we would normally do.</p></div>

### Managing YAML configs

A Rails app must have either a `config/database.yml` file or `config/mongoid.yml` in order to work on Cloud 66. We will create these files automatically if they don't exist. 

If you want to specify a different DB config per environment, you can name the files `config/database.yml.environment-name` (e.g. `config/database.yml.dev`)

If you don't want to use the standard config setup, you can also add a `config/database.yml.cloud66` or `config/mongoid.yml.cloud66` file instead.

We will prioritise these configs as follows:

1. Files ending `.cloud66`
2. Files ending with a `.environment-name`
3. The standard YAML config file
{% endif %}

## Database deployment types

### No database (external)
This option allows you to deploy your application without a database managed by Cloud 66, and is ideal for externally hosted databases.
Please note that if there is no connectivity to your database, or your database host is not configured correctly, the deployment will fail. {%if page.collection=='rails' %}For Rails apps, if you have a `url` set in your `database.yml` then we will assume that you are using an external DB.{% endif %}

### Local database
This option deploys your chosen database to the same server as your web server - this is intended primarily for development, as running your database locally in production is not advised. In this case, your application database configuration will be amended to target your local database server. If you scale up your web server, these settings will also be amend automatically to reflect your database configuration.

### Dedicated database
This option will automatically create a new server for your database and configure your application accordingly.

## Upgrading your database
Cloud 66 will not do in-place database upgrades, because this process may cause your application to stop working or may not be possible automatically. To upgrade your database through Cloud 66, we recommend that you create a new application (at which point Cloud 66 will deploy the newer database version).

Once the new application is created, you can migrate data from your old application to your new application.

{% if page.collection == 'rails' %}
## Control your Rails database migrations

Cloud 66 chooses a server to perform the migrations - all other servers will wait until the migrations are finished before continuing with deployment. You can see which server performs the migrations in the Application Overview, and change it using the `c66.migrations.run` [reserved tag](/rails/references/reserved-tags.html).

You can control your Rails database migrations by setting the `run.deploy.command` option through application settings via 
[Toolbelt](/rails/quickstarts/using-cloud66-toolbelt.html) which gives you the option of running migrations or not.

```shell
$ cx settings set -s my_stack run.deploy.command true
```

When you have disabled `run.deploy.command` in [Application settings](/{{page.collection}}/references/toolbelt.html#settings-variables), you still have the option to run migrations on a one-off deployment by clicking _Deploy_ -> _Deploy with options_ and selecting _Run database migrations_.
{%endif%}

## Customize your database configuration

You can customize the database configuration on your servers using [CustomConfig](/{{page.collection}}/tutorials/custom-config.html). CustomConfig is available for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis and MongoDB.

Editing and committing your database CustomConfig will perform the following steps on every database server in your application, one by one, sequentially:

- Check your template for Liquid syntax errors
- Determine the correct server configuration and prepare general variables
- Prepare custom variables for your database type (e.g. server_state)
- Compile the database configuration based on the information from the server and database type
- Upload the configuration to the server
- Restart your database

### Warning
<div class="notice notice-warning">
<p>A bad database configuration might stop your database from working. Take extra care to make sure the configuration is correct.</p>
</div>

### Database customization variables
There are a number of variables available for use in your database CustomConfig. Some are general for all database types, while others are database specific.

**Global variables**

The following variables are available to any database CustomConfig.

<table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
  <colgroup>
    <col width="20%"/>
    <col width="20%"/>
    <col width="60%"/>
  </colgroup>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Variable Name</th>
      <th>Type</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>server</td>
			<td>Hash</td>
            <td>Hash containing information about your server</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>cloud</td>
			<td>string</td>
      		<td>Application cloud</td>
		</tr>

			<td>integer</td>
            <td>Server core count</td>

</table>


**MySQL variables**

The following variables are only available in the MySQL CustomConfig.

<table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>

			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>server_state</td>
			<td>string</td>
            <td>Value can be <i>stand_alone</i>, <i>mysql_master</i> or <i>mysql_slave</i> based on your server status</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>server_id</td>
			<td>integer</td>
            <td>An ID used by MySQL replication to identify your server&#42;</td>
		</tr>
