## What you’ll need

*   [Cloud 66 account](https://app.cloud66.com/users/sign_up)
	-  Pull your code from Git (with a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/))
	- Provide an existing Docker image   
  
  
  
* Deployment credentials

	-  The API key for your cloud provider ([Deploy to your cloud](/deployment/deploy-to-your-cloud))
  

Alternatively, if you don't want to use a cloud provider, you can use your own server ( [Deploy to a registered server](https://cloud66-help.helpscoutdocs.com/article/23-registered-servers) )
