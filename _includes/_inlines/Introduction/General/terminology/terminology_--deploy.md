- **Deploy**

When you deploy your stack, Cloud 66 pushes the latest code available in your Git repository or Docker images to your servers.

- **Build**

The Cloud 66 build step occurs the first time you create a stack - this is when your servers are created and software is compiled.

- **Stack**

A web application stack is a set of hardware and software components needed for your application to run. It may include web servers, a database server, and a load balancer.

- **Provision**

When you build a stack with Cloud 66, we will provision servers in your cloud vendor account. This is synonymous with creating the servers.
