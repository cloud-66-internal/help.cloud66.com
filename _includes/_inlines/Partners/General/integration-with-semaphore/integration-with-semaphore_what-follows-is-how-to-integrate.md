What follows is how to integrate [Semaphore](https://semaphoreapp.com) with Cloud 66.

1. Make sure your stack is deployed with Cloud 66.
2. Setup your project on [Semaphore](https://semaphoreapp.com). Since you're reading this page, you probably have a Semaphore project setup already!
3. In Semaphore, go to your project setting and click on Deployment.

4. If you have no deployments configured, you can add your first server.

6. You will be redirected to your Cloud 66 account and asked if you give Semaphore permission to deploy your stacks on your behalf.

Done!
