### Add a rake task
This add-in allows you to schedule the execution of rake tasks.

You're then able to choose which server to run on, what to run, and when to run it.






## Note
* Rake tasks are executed using 
bundle exec
* Run results (success, failure and any output) can be seen in real-time on the detail page
* Make sure the rake task is running in the right environment
