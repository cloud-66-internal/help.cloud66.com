## About using Rackspace cloud

You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in any Rackspace [region](http://developers.cloud66.com/#cloud-vendor-instance-regions#rackspace). Note that if you hold a Rackspace UK account, you will be limited to creating servers in the London region. The Rackspace US account is able to create servers in the remaining regions.






## Generate a Rackspace API key

You need to provide your Rackspace API key in order for Cloud 66 to access your account. To generate a key, access the _Account_ dropdown in the top right of your Rackspace account, and go to the _User Management_ page. Once there, click _Create a new user_, and fill in the necessary details for this new user. This user must be created with **Full Access** in order for servers to be created in your account.

Once you click _Create user_, you will be able to view the API Key by clicking _Show_.






## Add Rackspace key to a stack

Visit the Cloud 66 Dashboard and select _Get started building a stack_. After connecting to your Git repository and analyzing your code, you will be asked to _Add your cloud platform_. From this menu, select _Rackspace_ and provide your API key.









### Notice

Should you wish to delete your stack on Cloud 66, your servers **will not** be deleted on your cloud provider unless [physical server deletion](/managing-your-stack/server-deletion) is turned on.
